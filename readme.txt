This plugin is built for people keen to reuse flickr images in their blogs. Searching for just CC-BY material the plugin helps to make using flickr content much more simple.

== Description ==
This plugin was developed for the Politics InSpires (http://politicsinspires.org) project at the University of Oxford.

The project was JISC Funded, and sits as part of "Open Spires" (ttp://openspires.oucs.ox.ac.uk/). Open Spires  is a project led by the Learning Technologies Group, Oxford University Computing Services, University of Oxford.

In terms of long term support, the code is being maintained by the Open Attribute team (http://openattribute.com).

This plugin allows you to search Flickr for various content (all licensed in some form) and then for you to bring that content into WordPress and attribute it correctly.

A simpler sister plug in is available which searches for just CC-BY.
